Installing
==========

Everything in the RCPub directory should be put on the server. The server must
be running MySQL. Visit the install/index.php page to install the software.
Note that the file path is not relative to the directory containing the
software, it is relative to the root directory of the website. Once the
installation is run, copy the config.php directory from the install directory
to the config directory. You may then visit the site, where some default stuff
will already be set up. The initial login is

Username: admin
Password: admin
