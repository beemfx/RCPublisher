RCPublisher
===========

RC Publisher is website powering software. It is written in PHP and MySQL and is
meant to be a very basic wiki-type web page editing template. This software is
provided in it's most basic form here for anyone desiring a similar easy to use
website.

This software is not really ready to power a website at this time. The following
features are still in development.

Version History
===============
5/12/2012 - The software is mostly functional. Most of the non-generic code has
bee cleaned out.

5/5/2012 - Quite a bit of progress made. Contact page and email pages need to
bee implemented to get the software as functional as it was previously. From
there everything will be new.

4/29/2012 - Initial upload. This version doesn't actually function as there is
no way to create the tables needed for the databases without manually creating
them. Basically this code has just been resurrected from a scrapped project and
I at least want to start the version history here until I can get it working.
